# FormFix
Form Fix is an AI-powered application designed to enhance movement analysis by providing real-time posture correction and feedback. It leverages advanced video processing technologies like OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow Lite to track body movements and detect form deviations. Users can upload exercise videos, which are analyzed using motion tracking algorithms to identify improper posture and suggest corrections. The app features a reference video comparison, a personalized feedback system, and a performance tracking dashboard. Built with React Native for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, it ensures a seamless and responsive experience. MongoDB stores user data securely, while AWS or Firebase provides cloud-based processing and storage. Designed for athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and rehabilitation patients, Form Fix makes movement analysis accessible beyond professional training environments. The application aims to reduce injury risks and improve workout efficiency through AI-driven insights. Future enhancements include wearable integration and expanded support for multiple sports and rehabilitation exercises. Form Fix is set to revolutionize exercise analysis with precision, accessibility, and real-time feedback. ðŸš€ðŸš€
